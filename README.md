# vscode-pretty-urls

@vscode let's create a vscode extension that changes the text color of "%20" in URLs to have lower opacity so it's easier to read

## Features

[LICENSE](LICENSE)
[a file with a bunch of spaces in the filename](<a file with a bunch of spaces in the filename.md>)

## Release Notes

- 2024-05-24 -- discovered the syntax above which allows for a link to a file with spaces in the filename without including a bunch of %20s in the URL. This makes it unnecessary to create this extension.
